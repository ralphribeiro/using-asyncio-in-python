# blocking() calls the traditional time.sleep() internally, which would have
# blocked the main thread and prevented your event loop from running. This
# means that you must not make this function a coroutine—indeed, you cannot
# even call this function from anywhere in the main thread, which is where the
# asyncio loop is running. We solve this problem by running this function
# in an executor.
def blocking():
    # Unrelated to this section, but something to keep in mind for later in the
    # book: note that the blocking sleep time (0.5 seconds) is shorter than the
    # nonblocking sleep time (1 second) in the main() coroutine. This makes the
    # code sample neat and tidy. In “Waiting for the Executor During Shutdown”
    # on page 68 we’ll explore what happens if executor functions outlive their
    # async counterparts during the shutdown sequence.

# This is the last of our list of essential, must-know features of asyncio.
# Sometimes you need to run things in a separate thread or even a separate
# process: this method is used for exactly that. Here we pass our blocking
# function to be run in the default executor. Note that run_in_executor()
# does not block the main thread: it only schedules the executor task to
# run (it returns a Future, which means you can await it if the method is
# called within another coroutine function). The executor task will begin
# executing only after run_until_complete() is called, which allows the
# event loop to start processing events.

# Further to the note in callout (line 25): the set of tasks in pending does
# not include an entry for the call to blocking() made in run_in_executor().
# This will be true of any call that returns a Future rather than a Task.
# The documentation is quite good at specifying return types, so you’ll see
# the return type there; just remember that all_tasks() really does return
# only Tasks, not Futures.
