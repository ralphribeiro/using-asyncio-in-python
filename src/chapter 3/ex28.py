# A simple coroutine function: sleep for a bit; then return the
# parameter plus 100.
async def f(x):

# This is an async generator, which we will call inside an async list
# comprehension abit farther down, using async for to
# drive the iteration.

        yield f, x

    # Finally, the async comprehension. This example has been contrived to
    # demonstrate a comprehension that includes both async for and await.
    # Let’s breakdown what’s happening inside the comprehension. First,
    # the factory(3) call returns an async generator, which must be driven
    # by iteration. Because it’s an async generator, you can’t just use for;
    # you must use async for.
    results = [await f(x) async for f, x, in factory(3)]
