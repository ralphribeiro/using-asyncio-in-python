# The nonblocking way
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager


# The new @asynccontextmanager decorator is used in exactly the same way.
@asynccontextmanager
# It does, however, require that the decorated generator function be
# declared with async def.
async def web_page(url):
    # As before, we fetch the data from the URL before making it available to
    # the body of the context manager. I have added the await keyword, which
    # tells us that this coroutine will allow the event loop to run other
    # tasks while we wait for the network call to complete. Note that we cannot
    # simply tack on the await keyword to anything. This change presupposes
    # that we were also able to modify the download_webpage() function itself,
    # and convert it into a coroutine that is compatible with the await
    # keyword. For the times when it is not possible to modify the function, a
    # different approach is needed; we’ll discuss that in the next example.
    data = await download_webpage(url)

    # As before, the data is made available to the body of the context manager.
    # I’m trying to keep the code simple, so I’ve omitted the usual try/finally
    # handler that you should normally write to deal with exceptions raised in
    # the body of caller.
    # Note that the presence of yield is what changes a function into a
    # generator function; the additional presence of the async def keywords in
    # line 6 makes this an asynchronous generator function. When called, it
    # will return an asynchronous generator. The inspect module has two
    # functions that can test for these:isasyncgenfunction() and
    # isasyncgen(), respectively
    yield data

    # Here, assume that we’ve also converted the code inside the update_stats()
    # function to allow it to produce coroutines. We can then use the await
    # keyword, which allows a context switch to the event loop while we wait
    # for the I/O-bound work to complete.
    await update_status(url)


# Another change was required in the usage of the context manager itself: we
# needed to use async with instead of a plain with.
async with web_page('ddg.gg') as data:
